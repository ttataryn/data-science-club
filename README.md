# Project Description/Details 

## Project Title: LinkedIn Job Data Analysis

## Short Description:

This project will look at data inside of LinkedIn and potentially other sites like Indeed. Using webscraping methods (primarily Beautiful Soup and Selenium), the purpose is to 
find potential skills or other areas that could glean important insights relevant to job postings. For instance, I am starting out with finding the most listed/popular 
programming languages that are found in a Software Engineering position. Following the scrape, the data will be visualized in some format to gain better insights and present it 
in a cleaner format. 

## Technologies and Good Resources: 
1. **Python** (Many websites can use to learn python -- TutorialsPoint, the Python website, etc.)
2. **Flask** (A python microframework that helps to implement html through python functions) (https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world)
3. **HTML + CSS** Used to display analysis and information (Also multiple great websites to use like Python -- simply google it)
4. **Pandas Dataframe** (Package great for putting together data into a clean table in python) (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python)
5. **Beautiful Soup** (Webscraping tool used to gather important data from job postings) (http://web.stanford.edu/~zlotnick/TextAsData/Web_Scraping_with_Beautiful_Soup.html)
